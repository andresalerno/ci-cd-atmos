## DevOps: A systematic literature review

- Nowadays, DevOps is the state-of-the-art software development approach with focus on agile concepts and operational aspects. (Perera et al., 2017, p. 1)

- ... use DevOps to deliver perfectly fitting customer-centric software solution to the market

- Review: 58 publications with the term DevOps (after applied all filters)

- group by three categories:
    - Determinants
        - Context
            - growth importance of IT Solutions
            - digital transformation
            - new challenges in IT Department
            - fast delivery of software
            - Continuous delivery describes the way of defining every change of code as a new potential release for production
        - Definitions
            - all sources agree on the fact that DevOps is a combination of Development and Operation
            - Many publications define DevOps as a method of principles which enables communication
            - Other publications keep a more holistic definition which defines DevOps as an umbrella concept that
            encompasses people, processes, and technologies required to connect development to execution
            between Development and Operations Team
            - Summarizing, there isn’t a unique definition of DevOps because the term can be applied to many areas
of the software development and operation. But the overall message, the combination of development
and operation in different fields of software development is clear
        - Enablers
            - CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing) - John Willis and Damon Edward
            - Along with this, culture is identified as important building block which creates an environment of collaboration
    - Concepts
        - Colaboration
        - Practices
        - Standards
    - Outcomes
        - Benefits
        - Challenges
        - Trends
- Review results:
    - As a conclusion it stated that DevOps have a positive effect on operational performance, IS development, quality assurance performance
- Quantitative analysis
    - DevOps is a very modern term, so that the first publications 
with focus on DevOps are dated in year 2011
- Qualitative Analysis
    -  high pressure from the market to adapt new capabilities for digital strategies and software 
development
    - (past) The recent software development world stand for long re
lease cycle, static development methods and fix time periods
    - Nowadays, the development of software has totally different requirements. Sustainable competitive ad
vantages are gained through a fast delivery of customer wanted features
    - At best, the feature is carried 
out in real time which satisfies the customer demand immediately. At this point the term continuous 
kicks in.
    -  Continuous delivery describes the way of defining every change of code as a new potential release for production
    - The code is forwarded to the continuous delivery pipeline in which it waits to get the approval to go productive.
- Definitions
    - Although nearly all sources agree on the fact that DevOps is a combination of Development and Operation, it isn’t enough to explain what DevOps exactly is.
    - Many publications define DevOps as a method of principles which enables communication between Development and Operations Team
    - ... others say that it is a develop ment method or software delivery technique
    - ...and a few define DevOps as automated deployment, continuous integration or quality assurance
    - Summarizing, there isn’t a unique definition of DevOps because the term can be applied to many areas of the software development and operation. But the overall message, the combination of development 
and operation in different fields of software development is clear.
- Enablers
    - CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing) - John Willis and Damon Edward
    - Along with this, culture is identified as important building block which creates an environment of collaboration
    -  The next aspect of the CAMS model is the need of measurement in a DevOps environment. All actions and processes must be mirrored in KPI’s to measure the delivery capability and the 
implementation of a continuous improvement framework.
    -  DevOps is about culture, automation/tools, measurement and sharing, but none of these terms can enable DevOps by its own
- Colaboration
    - But to create a 
successful collaboration environment four element are identified as crucial: open communication, alignment of responsibilities and incentives, respect and trust.
    -  Another important aspect is the clear align
ment of responsibilities and incentives within and across teams
- Practices
    - DevOps is about automation, continuous delivery, collaborative culture and bridging the gap between 
development and operation teams. To get all the mentioned concepts in place, tools are mandatory
    - That’s why huge organizations tend to development their own customized tools
Benefits
    - The main reason for gaining advantages in comparison to the traditional waterfall approach is the fact, that DevOps is data driven and merges separated teams.
    -  This results in a greater productivity, better applications and improved customer satisfaction.
Challenges
    - Apart from human skills and behavior, DevOps in a rather technical perspective is mainly about auto mation, which is based on tools and systems.
- what we know
    -  Hence, big digital giant who delivery software multiple times a day, tend to develop their own DevOps platforms, 
    which combine tools in an effective way
=- what we dont know
    - DevOps constitute a general approach for software development without a unique standard or frame work. That’s probably one of the reasons why many enterprises struggle to adapt DevOps
    - The literature doesn’t provide recommendations or a model how to deal with the dif
ferent views of development and operation teams. That’s the point where leadership can play an im
portant role

- Conclusion
    - Along with this, the literature doesn’t provide an adequate framework or process to adapt DevOps to an 
existing IT environment in enterprises.
